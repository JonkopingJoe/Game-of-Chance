## LUCKOMETER

LUCKOMETER is a thrilling game of chance that measures the luck of choices you make as the name suggests. The game starts at home and the day begins. The player starts off with a randomised choices and random luck score. You make your choices through the game and each choice has an effect to the overall luck score. It is highly randomised so no matter how much sensible the choice the player makes seems, there might be a twist when it comes to the luck score it carries. The players bet is to get the highest luck score at the end of the game.

Game: LUCKOMETER (name for now)

'no matter how sensible your choice sounds, there's always a twist'
name idea: twist of fate? lol // Twistopia //

- Base structure
  1. 1 player game
  2. Point system (luck points)
  3. Random scenarios throughout game: some interactive, some not
  4. Each event can be consequential

Game Initialisation: 
-
- Display an introduction message explaining the game mechanics and rules.

Gameplay:
-
- Start the day by triggering events in a loop until the day ends
- Each event should be randomly selected from a pool of possible scenarios

Point System:
-

- Determine thresholds for different luck score ranges and provide corresponding messages eg.:
- Luck score > 50: "It's your lucky day!! Buy a lottery ticket asap!"
- Luck score < 30: "Looks like it's not your day. Maybe stay indoors?"
- 30 <= Luck score <= 50: "Not too shabby. Keep it up!"
